This JavaScript-Algorithm simulates SalesTransactions for a Wholesaler.

By clicking the .html-File a popup will show from which you can copy the JSON data of salesTransactions. Thereafter you can convert the data to an .xlsx-File for example with the following site: https://convertio.co/de/xlsx-xls/

If the JSON data is too big you can convert the json to a .csv-File first (http://jsfiddle.net/vUnF9/2382/) and afterwards to an .xlsx-File (https://convertio.co/de/xlsx-xls/).
