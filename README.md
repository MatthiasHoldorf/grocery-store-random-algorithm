This JavaScript-Algorithm simulates SalesTransactions for a Wholesaler.

By clicking the .html-File a popup will show from which you can copy the JSON data of salesTransactions. Thereafter you can convert the data to an .xlsx-File for example with the following site: http://www.json-xls.com/json2xls

If the JSON data is too big you can convert the json to a .csv-File first (http://jsfiddle.net/vUnF9/2382/) and afterwards to an .xlsx-File (http://www.json-xls.com/json2xls).
